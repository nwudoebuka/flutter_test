# market_stock

A Stock Market Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point of the proposed Stock Market application.

This project is basically to show the list 10 or more random companies and their stock

There is a date range to filter between days of their daily stock market

There is also a search box for filtering from the list of companies in order to check their daily stock

Thanks
